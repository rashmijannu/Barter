Project Title: BARTER

Abstract :

The Barter is a skill-matching platform that connects individuals based on what they want to learn and what they can teach—enabling a mutual skill exchange. Using a matchmaking algorithm (strictly for learning!), users are paired with complementary partners for one-on-one sessions, chats, resource sharing, and progress tracking. It creates a community-driven ecosystem where people can grow together—without monetary barriers.

Introduction:

In today’s fast-paced world, the desire to learn new skills is stronger than ever—but access to quality learning opportunities often comes with financial and accessibility barriers. At the same time, there are countless individuals with unique skills and knowledge, but no structured space to share or exchange them meaningfully.
Barter is a community-driven skill-sharing platform designed to bridge this gap. It connects individuals based on the skills they want to learn and those they can teach, enabling a mutual exchange without monetary transactions. Powered by a smart matchmaking algorithm—much like a dating app, but purely for learning—users can discover compatible partners, schedule interactive sessions, share resources, and track their learning progress.
Barter transforms learning into a collaborative experience, fostering a culture of growth, connection, and empowerment—where talent is currency, and everyone has something valuable to offer.
